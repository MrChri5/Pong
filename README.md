# Pong

This program is a single player game of Pong. 
The user controls the paddle with the Up/Down or W/S keys and attempts to return the ball as many times as possible.
It includes features such as a score counter, changing colours, and variations in ball speed and direction.

I used this project as a simple introduction to some basic concepts in C# as well as WinForms drawing tools.
